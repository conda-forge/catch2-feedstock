  summary: |
    A modern, C++-native, test framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD
    - using C++14, C++17 and later (C++11 support is in v2.x branch, and C++03 on the Catch1.x branch)
  description: |
    Catch2 is mainly a unit testing framework for C++,
    but it also provides basic micro-benchmarking features, and simple BDD macros.

    Catch2's main advantage is that using it is both simple and natural.
    Test names do not have to be valid identifiers,
    assertions look like normal C++ boolean expressions,
    and sections provide a nice and local way to share set-up and tear-down code in tests.
